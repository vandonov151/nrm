1.Transfer Your Flask Application Files:
Use secure methods like SFTP or SSH to transfer your Flask application files (including app.py, templates, static, and other required files) to your server. Some hosting providers may offer web-based file managers to simplify this process.

2.Install Dependencies:
Log in to your server and install the required dependencies for your Flask application. This may include Python, Flask, and any other Python packages used in your application.
$ pip install -r requirements.txt


3.Configure the Web Server:
Set up the web server to serve your Flask application. For example, if you are using Apache or Nginx, you'll need to configure them to serve the application using a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI.
Run Your Flask Application:
Start your Flask application on the server. Use Gunicorn or uWSGI to run the app in the background. For example, if you are using Gunicorn, you can run:
					gunicorn app:app

4.Set Up Domain and DNS:
If you have a custom domain name, configure your domain's DNS settings to point to your server's IP address. You'll typically create an "A" record or "CNAME" record pointing to your server.

5.Test Your Application:
Once everything is set up, access your application using the domain name or IP address in a web browser. Ensure that your application works as expected.

6.Enable HTTPS:
To secure your website, set up SSL/TLS certificates to enable HTTPS. Many hosting providers offer free SSL certificates through Let's Encrypt or similar services.

7.Monitor and Maintain:
Regularly monitor your application's performance and security. Keep your software and dependencies up to date, and be prepared to handle traffic spikes.
